# Sample setting for Adminer: http://adminer.org/

# -----------------------------------------
# How to get it working:
#
#   mkdir PH_HTTPD_SERVERROOT/adminer
#   cd PH_HTTPD_SERVERROOT/adminer
#   wget http://www.adminer.org/latest.php
#   chmod +x latest.php
#
# Warning: for security concern, it's recommended to change the URL '/adminer'
#          to another random string to avoid login attempts from bad guys.
#          for example, change the url to '^/HIoWCwogSHukIbGL'.
#
# -----------------------------------------
# If you cannot login to MySQL server as root user:
#
# New MySQL or MariaDB support plugin authentication, by default, the root
# account has setting `user.plugin=unix_socket` (in `mysql` database). The
# `auth_socket` authentication plugin authenticates clients that connect from
# the local host through the Unix socket file, this prevents access via network
# connection, including Adminer. To make it working, please disable this
# authentication plugin with sql commands below:
#
#   sql> USE mysql;
#   sql> UPDATE user SET plugin='' WHERE User='root';
#
# Refer to MySQL document for more details:
# https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/socket-authentication-plugin.html
