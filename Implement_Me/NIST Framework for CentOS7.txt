## United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB / STIG) 

#Ensure yum removes previous package versions 
#set clean_requirements_on_remove to 1 in /etc/yum.conf 

#Ensure gpgcheck enabled for local packages: verify signatures of local packages prior to install.
#set localpkg_gpgcheck to 1 in /etc/yum.conf 
#set repo_gpgcheck to 1 in /etc/yum.conf 

#Verify that the file permissions, ownership, and gruop membership of system files and commands match vendor values. 
# Check the file permissions, ownership, and group membership with the following command: $ sudo rpm -Va | grep '^.M' Output indicates files that do not match vendor defaults. After locating a file with incorrect permissions, run the following command to determine which package owns it: $ rpm -qf FILENAME Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to the correct values: $ sudo rpm --setperms PACKAGENAME 

#Disable GDM Automatic Login 
# To disable user ability to automatically login to the system, set the AutomaticLoginEnable to false in the [daemon] section in /etc/gdm/custom.conf. For example: [daemon] AutomaticLoginEnable=false  

#Disable GDM guest Login 
# To do disable timed logins or guest account access, set the TimedLoginEnable to false in the [daemon] section in /etc/gdm/custom.conf. For example: [daemon] TimedLoginEnable=false 

#prevent log in to accounts with empty password 
#Remove any instances of the nullok option in /etc/pam.d/system-auth to prevent logins with empty passwords.  

#Limit number of concurrent login sessions allowed per user 
To set the number of concurrent sessions per user add the following line in /etc/security/limits.conf: * hard maxlogins 10 

#Modify system login banner 
#To configure the system login banner edit /etc/issue 

#Ensure system is not acting as a network sniffer 
Run the following to determine if any interface is running in promiscuous mode: $ ip link | grep PROMISC  

#Disable kernel paramenter for sending ICMP redirects by default 
To set the runtime status of the net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects kernel parameter, run the following command: $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0 If this is not the system's default value, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf: net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0 

#Disable Kernel parameter for sending icmp redirects for all itnerfaces 
To set the runtime status of the net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects kernel parameter, run the following command: $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0 If this is not the system's default value, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf: net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0 

#Disable Kernal Parameter for IP forwarding 
run the following command: $ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 If this is not the system's default value, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf: net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 

#Configure Kernal paramenter for accepting source-routed for all interfaces 

#Configure Kernal parameter... etc 

#Start firewalld 
$ sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service 

#Set default firewalld zone for incoming packets 
To set the default zone to drop for the built-in default zone which processes incoming IPv4 and IPv6 packets, modify the following line in /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf to be: DefaultZone=drop 

#Ensure cron is logging to rsyslog 
Cron logging must be implemented to spot intrusions or trace cron job status. If cron is not logging to rsyslog, it can be implemented by adding the following to the RULES section of /etc/rsyslog.conf: cron.* /var/log/cron  

#Ensure logs sent to remote host
To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server, open /etc/rsyslog.conf and read and understand the last section of the file, which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate remote logging. Along with these other directives, the system can be configured to forward its logs to a particular log server by adding or correcting one of the following lines, substituting loghost.example.com appropriately. The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system; although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery, they may not be supported in all environments. To use UDP for log message delivery: *.* @loghost.example.com To use TCP for log message delivery: *.* @@loghost.example.com To use RELP for log message delivery: *.* :omrelp:loghost.example.com 

#Ensure rsyslog does not accept remote messages unless acting as log server 
The rsyslog daemon should not accept remote messages unless the system acts as a log server. To ensure that it is not listening on the network, ensure the following lines are not found in /etc/rsyslog.conf: $ModLoad imtcp $InputTCPServerRun port $ModLoad imudp $UDPServerRun port $ModLoad imrelp $InputRELPServerRun port 

#enable auditd 
The auditd service is an essential userspace component of the Linux Auditing System, as it is responsible for writing audit records to disk. The auditd service can be enabled with the following command: $ sudo systemctl enable auditd.service  

#Configure auditd: auditing for processes which start prior to the audit daemon, number of logs retained, max log file size, flush priority 

#configure auditd to use audispd's syslog plugin 
To configure the auditd service to use the syslog plug-in of the audispd audit event multiplexor, set the active line in /etc/audisp/plugins.d/syslog.conf to yes. Restart the auditd service: $ sudo service auditd restart 

#Shutdown system when auditing failures occur 
If the auditd daemon is configured to use the augenrules program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the following line to a file with suffix .rules in the directory /etc/audit/rules.d: -f 2 If the auditd daemon is configured to use the auditctl utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to the top of the /etc/audit/audit.rules file: -f 2 

#Record attempts to alter time through adjtimex, settimeofday, stine, clock_settime
#record attempts to modify /etc/group, /etc/gshadow, /etc/shadow, passwd, opasswd 
#record attempts that modify system's network environment 
#record events that have mode 0640 or less permissive 
#system audit logs must be owned by root 
#record events that modify the system's mandatory access controls, chmod, chown, fchmod, fchmodat, fchown, fremoveexattr, fsetxattr, lchown, lremovexattr, lsetxattr, removexattr, setxattr
#record events that alter logon and logout events: tallylog, faillock, lastlog 
Record attempts to atler process and session initiation information 
Record attempts to files: creat, open, openat, open_by_handle_at, truncate, ftruncate. 
Record any attempt to run semange, setsebool, chcon, restorecon  
Ensure auditd collects info on the use of: passwd, unix_chkpwd, gpasswd, chage, userhlper, su, sudo, sudoedit, newgrp, chsh, umount, postdrop, postqueue, ssh-keysign, pt_chown, crontab, pam_timestamp_check 
Ensure auditd collect file deletion events: rmdir, unlink, unlinkat, rename, renameat
